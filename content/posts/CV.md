# Summary
•	Passionate bench scientist with over 10 years of experience in studying the broad area in disease models, which includes metabolic diseases, neuroscience, cancer and, has provided me with a diverse skillset that I can apply to my future research. Exceptional proficiencies in Molecular biology & Biochemistry including but not limited to Western blot, qPCR, ChIP, Cloning, establishing knockout cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 lentivirus delivery system, and protein purification.


•	Enthusiastic computational biologist with over 3 years of experience working with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data including bulk RNA seq, single-cell RNA seq, and Whole genome bisulphite sequencing (WGBS). Wrote customized scripts for data visualization in Python and R. Strong debugging and problem-solving skills.
